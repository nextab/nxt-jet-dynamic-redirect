# nxt-jet-dynamic-redirect
Adds a redirection logic to WordPress pages (as well as posts and / or custom post types) that allows you to redirect non-logged in users or users that lack permissions, etc. Requires JetEngine (or Advanced Custom Fields or a similar solution) to add meta fields to the pages.

# Installation:
- Use the .json in the import folder to add custom meta boxes to pages / posts / custom post types in WordPress
- Upload the .php file into a plugin folder or directly upload it as a new plugin in WordPress
- Activate the plugin
- Make the required changes for each of your pages that you want to redirect dynamically
